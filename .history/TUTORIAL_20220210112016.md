## Create Magic 8-Ball App

To create the magic 8 ball app, we write:


```
import React, { useState } from "react";
const answers = [
  "It is certain",
  "It is decidedly so",
  "Without a doubt",
  "Yes - definitely",
  "You may rely on it",
  "As I see it, yes",
  "Most likely",
  "Outlook good",
  "Yes",
  "Signs point to yes",
  "Don't count on it",
  "My reply is no",
  "My sources say no",
  "Outlook not so good",
  "Very doubtful",
  "Reply hazy, try again",
  "Ask again later",
  "Better not tell you now",
  "Cannot predict now",
  "Concentrate and ask again"
];

export default function App() {
  const [question, setQuestion] = useState("");
  const [answer, setAnswer] = useState("");

  const getAnswer = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (!question) {
      return;
    }
    const index = Math.floor(Math.random() * answers.length);
    setAnswer(answers[index]);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <style>
        {`
          .circle {
            border: 1px solid black;
            border-radius: 50%;
            width: 150px;
            height: 150px;
            display: flex;
            justify-content: center;
            align-items: center;
          }
          `}
      </style>
      <form onSubmit={getAnswer}>
        <div>
          <label>question</label>
          <input
            value={question}
            onChange={(e) => setQuestion(e.target.value)}
          />
        </div>
        <button type="submit">get answer</button>
      </form>
      <div className="circle">
        <p>{answer}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

We have the ```answers``` array with the answer items that can be chosen.

Then we define the ```question``` state which is set by entering the input.

And ```answer``` state is set by choosing an entry from the ```answers``` array randomly.

Then we gave the getAnswer function that picks the answer after the question is entered.

We call e.preventDefault() to do client-side submission.

We check if question is set.

And if it is, then we call setAnswer to set the answer .

Below that, we have a form with an input to let us enter the question value.

We get the value in the value prop and set the value with the onChange prop.

e.target.value has the inputted value.

answer has the answer that’s randomly chosen.

We put the answer in a circle by setting the className to circle .
